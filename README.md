## Problem Statement: 
“Count Dracula, the owner of the Hotel Transylvania, wants to celebrate the 118th birthday of his beloved daughter, Mavis, so he invites some of the famous monsters to the celebration. For those
who don’t know, Hotel Transylvania is a place where the world’s
monsters can take a rest from human civilization. Hence, Dracula
needs to ensure that the hotel booking system is managed efficiently;
that is, monsters are given more priority than humans, and if a
human arrives and the general rooms are occupied, then they can be
allotted special rooms only after getting the permission of
Dracula, the owner.
